# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data_Assign

## Introduction

This README was created in order to explain how the code on the file run_analysis.R works, and how the output of this code is tidy. It was divided into 8 itens in order to make it easier for whoever is grading this assignment:

0. Preparation and importing data
1. Merging data
2. Selecting data
3. Naming activity labels
4. Naming Variables
5. Tyding dataset
6. Saving and cleaning workspace

The itens from 1 to 5 correspond each to a requirement from the assignment. I'm not sure on how this assignment will be evaluated so if you have any doubts on how a particular step was fullfiled in the R code, you may want to come to this README and consult the corresponding part.

Before starting the code explanation here are somethings you should now before runing it (in case you need to).
- To run this code you must have installed the packages ```R dplyr ``` and ```R tidyr ```;
